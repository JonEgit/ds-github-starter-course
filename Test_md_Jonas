## Intro / What about?

This is a test markdown file by **Jonas**. This was asked as optional next step for the * * starter course * *.

### What I've learned so far 

I've learned what 'Github' is about and how to generally collaborate on projects and code. 
For this 'Github' provides specific steps which can be taken such as forking a projects or using pull requests to submit changes.
I've created my own 'Github' profile which can be found [here](https://github.com/JonEgit/JonEgit).

### What I'm still confused about

As always... so many things ðŸ˜‰. But thats why i'm here to learn. Whereas i do got a better overview over 'Github' the best way to get used to 
everything is (for me) learning by doing. Especially regarding how to handle workflows.
